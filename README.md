# CARRoT
CARRoT: R package for predictive modelling by means of regression adjusted for multiple regularisation methods
The package itself is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CARRoT/index.html

carrot_function_rsq.r - the original CARRoT script

carrot_functions_mod_si_las.r - the file allowing to compare CARRoT output with the output of the models constituted by only statistically significant predictors and lasso regression

carrot_functions_mod_si_las_ada.r - the file allowing to compare CARRoT output with the output of the models constituted by only statistically significant predictors and adaptive lasso regression

carrot_functions_mod_step_las.r - the file allowing to compare CARRoT output with the output of the models constituted by onlystepwise forward selection based on Akaike Information Criteria


table3_carrot.r - script to replicate Table 11 from the paper

carrot_table_new.r - script to replicate the results of Tables S1 and S2
carrot_table_new_ada.r - script to replicate the results of Tables S1 and S2 for stepwise forward selection
